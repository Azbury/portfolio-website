                <p>My name is Austin Asbury and I recently graduated from the Flatiron School for Software Engineering Bootcamp.
                   I chose the self-paced program because I had prior experience coding from the University of Maryland located in College Park, MD where I majored in Computer Science.
                   Completing the self-paced program meant I had no one to monitor my progress through the course work so I had to learn how to manage my time properly to complete the school
                   work and meet deadlines that I set for myself while working full-time.
                </p>
            </div>
