                <p className="about-me-description">My name is Austin Asbury and I recently graduated from the Flatiron School for Software Engineering Bootcamp.
                   I chose the self-paced program because I had prior experience coding from the University of Maryland located in College Park, MD where I majored in Computer Science.
                   Completing the self-paced program meant I had no one to monitor my progress through the course work so I had to learn how to manage my time properly to complete the school
                   work and meet deadlines that I set for myself while working full-time. This gave me a ton of practice for what it would be like to be working at a job with minimal supervision
                   and prepared me to become a developer that meets and exceeds deadlines given to them. I will do whatever it takes to make sure a project is completed on time, without
                   compromising on quality.
